### Project Motivation
The goal of this project is to understand the airbnb market in Seattle, which can help the travelers to make better decisions when they book accommodations. Here are the questions I am delving into:
  1. What are the busiest times to visit Seattle? By how much do prices increase?
  2. What's the common type of property in each neighborhood? How does the price differ from each other?
  3. On average how many days are the listings available? Is there any trend that exists?
  4. What are the key topics based on the reviews?
